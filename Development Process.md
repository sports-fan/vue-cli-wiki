## Roadmap

The team has a 6-12 months high level [[Roadmap]] which defines high level themes and features to be addressed in this timeframe.

## Iterations

We work on a roughly six-week iteration schedule. That means, a new minor/major release every six weeks if everything goes as expected.

The six-week-cycle is commonly adopted in the web development ecosystem. E.g., the two major browser vendors, [Chrome](https://blog.chromium.org/2010/07/release-early-release-often.html) and [Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2011/07/19/every-six-weeks/), both promoted a six-week release schedule. It is also [recommended by the Basecamp team](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01#six-week-cycles).

## Inside an Iteration

We work in weekly segments:
- **Week 1-2**:
	- Address critical issues uncovered in the previous iteration
	- Reduce debt introduced in the previous iteration
	- Plan the next iteration
- **Week 3-5**: Work according to the plan
- **Final Week**: Endgame
	-  The team tests the new features according to a test plan and updates the documentation. 
	  - We make a pre-release available on the ‘next’ channel and invite users to help us test the pre-release.
- **Week 1 (next iteration)**: 
	  - monitoring the pre-release and fixing critical issues.
	  - publish the release to the ‘latest’ channel, sometime midweek, after 24 hours with no changes to the pre-release.
